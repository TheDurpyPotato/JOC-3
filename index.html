	<p>I don't really know what to put here so I'll talk a bit about myself. My main pastimes consist of reading (fantasy, action, Sci-Fi), building legos (Star Wars and Ninjago), volunteering at my local NASA center, and playing Video Games (Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order, Overwatch 2, Terraria). That's about it.</p>
